## **WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is the material for the course [Elements of Computational Modeling in Julia](http://www.informatica.uniroma2.it/f0?fid=220&srv=0&os=2021&cdl=0&id=ECMJ) which [I](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Emanuele.Natale/) have been teaching at [University of Rome Tor Vergata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rome_Tor_Vergata) in 2022, and it is heavily based on the course [Introduction to Computational Thinking del MIT (2021)](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/).
